# googlesearchengine_subdomains
This project is a Python script designed to scrape subdomains using Google Custom Search Engine (GSE). The script reads a list of API keys, search modifiers, and manages the usage of these keys to avoid exceeding usage limits. Results are stored in text files, and duplicates are removed at the end of each run.
